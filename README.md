# Organization Hub

Version 1.0

## Summary

The Organization Hub is a collection of useful tools for maintaining a multisite WordPress instance for an organization.

The Organization Hub (Network) is designed to be used by network administrators in order to keep track of current users, site stats, and to make batch changes to the WordPress sites.  The [Users](https://github.com/clas-web/organization-hub/wiki/Users) page keeps track of the organization users, their profile site, and any connections posts (see [Connections Hub](https://github.com/clas-web/connections-hub)).  The [Sites](https://github.com/clas-web/organization-hub/wiki/Sites) page is a listing of all the current sites, its posts and pages count, and the last time it was updated and by whom.  The [Upload](https://github.com/clas-web/organization-hub/wiki/Batch-Upload) page is used to batch import large amounts of posts, pages, links, taxonomies, users, and sites. 

The Organization Hub (Site) is designed for individual sites and only includes the [batch upload](https://github.com/clas-web/organization-hub/wiki/Batch-Upload) capabilities.
